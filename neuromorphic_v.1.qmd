## Do Brains Compute?
- What is a computation?
- Are brains computers?

## Turing Machines
- Inspired by humans

## Turing Machines
- A single read/write head can compute any algorithm.

## Von Neumann Architecture
- The computer as we know it:
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    Input --> CPU
    CPU <--> Memory
    Memory <--> CPU
    CPU --> Output
```

- Input data flows into CPU 
- Data is shuttled back and forth from CPU to memory as computation happens 
- Output data is stored or sent to I/O devices.

## Von Neumann Architecture

:::{.notes}
While computers were always intended to be something like a brain, they were maybe based on a particular type (very idealized) of mind.
:::

## Artificial Intelligence
- By the 1960s, prominent researchers felt AI was around the corner.
- Early ANNs were models of biological systems

## Artificial Intelligence

:::{.notes}
The perceptron was invented in 1943 by Warren McCulloch, a psychologist.
:::

## Artificial Intelligence
- AI Winter 1970s-1990s
- AI Summer 2000s-current
- At some point, biological inspiration failed to add value.

## AI Hardware
- DNNs lean heavily on matrix multiplications.

## GPUs
- GPUs are good at matrix multiplication.
- GPUs are in high demand.

:::{.notes}
Microsoft reported one site in Wyoming because of its proximity to a pentagon data center and nuclear missile base. Records show other cryptocurrency facilities have ties to the Chinese state.
:::

## GPUs
- Meta is purchasing around $10B of Nvidia H100 GPUs.

:::{.notes}
By the end of 2024, Zuckerberg said that infrastructure will include 350,000 H100 graphics cards from Nvidia. As of today, H100s cost about 30k. 30k*350k = 10.5 billion dollars.

## NorthPole
- IBM's new "neural inference" chip
- Outperforms GPUs per joule

The increased energy consumption shown in red matches the shape of the bird,
demonstrating the in situ, activity-dependent neural computation of NorthPole that requires minimal
communication between neighboring cores

## The Future?
- Cognitive-system computers?
- Do neuromorphic innovations mean anything for biology?
- Will computing technology move closer or farther from its biological roots?
