## Overview
- Brief history of digital computers
- Biologically-inspired computation
- What is the goal?

## Do Brains Compute?
- What is a computation?
- Are brains computers?

## Turing Machines
- Inspired by humans
- A read/write head can approximate any function.
- Theoretical

## Von Neumann Architecture
- The computer as we know it:

    Input --> CPU
    CPU <-->|Fetch/Store| Memory
    Memory <--> CPU
    CPU --> Output
```

- Input data flows into CPU 
- Data is shuttled back and forth from CPU to memory as computation happens 
- Output data is stored or sent to I/O devices.

## Artificial Intelligence
- The MIT meeting
- ANNs were models of biological systems
- The AI winter

## Artificial Intelligence
- The ANN comeback
- At some point, biological inspiration failed to add value.

## AI Hardware
- DNNs are matrix multiplications.
- GPUs are good at matrix multiplication.
- GPUs are in demand. 

## Neuromorphic Computing
- Spiking Neural Networks
- Neuromorphic Hardware
